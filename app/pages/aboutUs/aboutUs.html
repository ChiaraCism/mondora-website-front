                            mondora’s developers are required to have a horizontal knowledge: there are no vertical specializations, everyone must be a full-stack developer. In this way, developers are able to be more flexible and meet customer needs more quickly and effectively.

                            mondora is a self-organized company with a flat structure. This means that everyone is on the same level, including the CEO. Only the customer is above, as the company has a “customer centered” work approach in which customer happiness is key. Self-organization implies that every employee within the company takes responsibility for his or her own work. There are no managers, only “team players”. Each person, or player, agrees on work with his/her team, makes autonomous decisions and consults colleagues for complex issues.

                            Most work within mondora is done in teams. Teams work together to create solutions and solve issues. Within a team, junior members can learn from more senior ones. Often team members work in pairs, either in the office or remotely. This is a great way for people to acquire new skills and see how others work. One important aspect of this organization is that teams are not fixed for the whole duration of a project. Team rotation is encouraged and all players are expected to take part in different projects and learn to use various technologies during their time in mondora.

                            Everyone in mondora uses Scrum, Kanban, DDD and embraces Agile methodologies. Work is done in sprints of two weeks each, in which something useful is delivered to the customer right from the start, every two weeks. Teams and customers get together for sprint planning/review meetings and Daily Scrum meetings. mondora helps customers identify the issues they need to solve and provides an Empathy Map, Value Proposition Canvas and a Business Model Canvas to them. The aim is to help customers reach understanding of the Minimum Viable Product required, and work towards reaching this goal first.
